# LLM-benchmark
We benchmark real LLM [FLOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) that training large lanugage models can achieve on various GPUs, including single GPU, multi-GPUs, and multi-machines. It helps you to estimate how many machine times you need to train your large-scale language models.
